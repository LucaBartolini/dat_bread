## Ingredients
450g Whole Wheat 
450g High Protein
100g Rye
775g water (lukewarm)
22g salt
~60g mature starter (i make no *levain* and I use enough to have the dough ready for the cold proofing in the evening)
[optional] 5g malt (barley, diastatic)  
 
## Process 
- (usually in the morning) Mix all the ingredients at once (no autolysis or extra care - tryna be efficient here)
- Hand a couple of mins, rest ~5 min, handmix another 5 minutes ([rubaud method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg&t=75s))
- Stretch+fold each ~20 minutes, ~4 times, at first more vigorously then more and more gently to avoid degassing
- Sometimes, in the winter, I put the rising dough on a heatmat, but it's not necessary (though within the proper range, lower temps favor bacteria and a more sour flavor, whereas higher temps favor yeast and a more bubbly dough)
- When dough looks airy and wiggly: pre-shape, let rest ~15min
- Shaping is *very important* and there are plenty of videos ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBid79t6rcw&t=89s)). I usually shape a "batard".
- Cover with seeds, and then into the banneton. Cover the banneton with a linen cloth, then into a plastic bag and into the fridge 

## Baking
Baking needs a separate section. I bake at 230°C on a steel baking plate. 
It is important to have high humidity in the oven. In my setup, there is  tray with old cotton rugs soaked in water, and another  tray with lava rocks (will explain later)    
When bread is ready, I slice the dough with a razor at 45° wrt the surface (means keeping the blade pretty much horizontal, this matters) 
Spray the dough and throw in the oven 
Separately, I had some water boiling in the kettle. I made a contraption with wire and a mason jar, so that I can pour the boiling water onto the lava rocks. That will make a lot of steam, so that the crust stays soft at first (letting the ear develop) and turns glossy at the end. 
Baking 20 minutes, then remove the tray with the wet rugs, lower to 220° and bake another 20min.
